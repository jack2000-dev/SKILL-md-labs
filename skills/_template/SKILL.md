# Skill Name

One-sentence pitch. What outcome does the user get?

## Why This Skill Exists

Explain the problem this skill solves and what makes it valuable. Why should Claude use the structured workflow here instead of improvising? Today's models are smart — give them the *why* and they'll follow more reliably than they would with rigid rules.

Keep this short (3–6 sentences).

## When to Use

This is reinforcement of the description for Claude's benefit when the body loads. Be concrete.

**Use when:**
- User says: "[trigger phrase 1]"
- User says: "[trigger phrase 2]"
- User uploads a [file type] and asks for [outcome]
- User describes: [scenario in plain language]

**Do NOT use when:**
- The request is a simple lookup (handle directly)
- The request belongs to [adjacent skill] instead
- [Other near-miss case]

## Critical

(Use this section for must-not-skip rules. The guide recommends `## Important` or `## Critical` headers — NOT burying critical rules inside prose. Repeat key points if needed. Delete this section if the skill has no hard rules.)

**CRITICAL: Before [main action], verify:**
- [Precondition 1]
- [Precondition 2]
- [Precondition 3]

For deterministic validations, prefer bundling a script in `scripts/` over relying on language interpretation — code is reliable, prose isn't.

## Instructions

Write in imperative form. Number steps when order matters.

### Step 1: [First Major Action]

What happens here, what input is needed, what output is produced.

```bash
# Example command if scripts are bundled
python scripts/do_thing.py --input {filename}
```

Expected output: [describe success state in one line]

### Step 2: [Second Major Action]

Before performing [action], consult `references/<file>.md` for:
- [Topic 1 — e.g., rate limits]
- [Topic 2 — e.g., schema details]
- [Topic 3 — e.g., error codes]

(This is the "progressive disclosure" pattern: keep SKILL.md lean, push detail to `references/` and link with explicit pointers about *when* to read it.)

### Step 3: [...]

[...]

## Output Format

ALWAYS use this exact structure (adjust to your skill):

```markdown
# [Title]
## [Section 1]
## [Section 2]
## [Section 3]
```

If output is non-text (file, chart, structured data), describe shape:
- File type: `.docx` / `.csv` / `.png`
- Schema: `{field: type, ...}`
- Naming convention: `<topic>-<date>.ext`

## Examples

### Example 1 — Common case

**Input:** "[sample user prompt]"

**Actions:**
1. [What Claude does first]
2. [What Claude does second]
3. [What Claude does third]

**Output:** [expected result, abbreviated]

### Example 2 — Edge case

**Input:** "[trickier user prompt]"

**Actions:**
1. [How Claude handles it]

**Output:** [expected result]

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: [Common error or failure mode]
**Cause:** [Why it happens]
**Solution:** [How to handle it]

### Issue: [Another common problem]
**Cause:** [Why]
**Solution:** [Fix]

## Bundled Resources

(Delete this section if no bundled files.)

- `scripts/<name>.py` — [what it does, when to call it]
- `references/<name>.md` — [what's in it, when to read it] (load only when needed)
- `assets/<name>` — [template/icon/font used in output]

For large reference files (>300 lines), include a table of contents in the reference itself so Claude can jump to the right section.

## Authoring Notes (delete before publishing)

This template follows the Anthropic Agent Skills standard. Quick checklist before publishing:

**Frontmatter:**
- [ ] `name` is kebab-case, matches folder name, no "claude"/"anthropic" prefix (reserved)
- [ ] `description` includes WHAT the skill does AND WHEN to use it
- [ ] `description` includes specific trigger phrases the user would type
- [ ] `description` is under 1024 characters
- [ ] No XML angle brackets (`<` `>`) anywhere in frontmatter (security restriction)
- [ ] Description is slightly "pushy" — explicitly says "trigger even when user doesn't say X" to fight undertriggering
- [ ] Has `---` delimiters at top and bottom
- [ ] No unclosed quotes in description

**Body:**
- [ ] Instructions are specific and actionable, not vague ("validate the data" → "run `python scripts/validate.py`")
- [ ] Critical rules use `## Critical` or `## Important` callouts at the TOP — not buried in prose
- [ ] Ambiguous phrasing rewritten ("make sure things are validated properly" → explicit `CRITICAL:` list)
- [ ] At least 2 examples (common + edge case)
- [ ] Troubleshooting covers ≥2 common failure modes
- [ ] Heavy reference material moved to `references/` with explicit pointers about *when* to read each
- [ ] For deterministic validations, bundle a script in `scripts/` rather than relying on language
- [ ] Total SKILL.md under ~500 lines (5,000 words hard ceiling per Anthropic guide)

**Folder:**
- [ ] Folder name matches `name` field exactly (kebab-case)
- [ ] `SKILL.md` filename is exact case (not `Skill.md`, `SKILL.MD`, `skill.md`)
- [ ] No `README.md` inside skill folder (use repo-level README for humans)
- [ ] `evals/cases.md` exists with ≥3 trigger tests + ≥3 behavior tests

**Triggering quality (after writing):**
- [ ] Test 5 obvious-trigger prompts — should fire
- [ ] Test 5 paraphrased prompts — should fire
- [ ] Test 5 near-miss prompts (share keywords, different intent) — should NOT fire
- [ ] Ask Claude in fresh session: "When would you use the [skill name] skill?" — answer should match the description's intent

If undertriggering: add specific phrases and "trigger even if..." language to description.
If overtriggering: add explicit "Do NOT use when..." negatives to description.
